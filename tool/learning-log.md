* I used a picture that I downloaded last year to get a picture and used multiple ways to change it.
* For Example I used Blur, pixelate, black and white, grayscale, and many more.

```
movie = image();
movie.source = "loki.jpeg";
blur(5);
noise(5);
exposure(90);
grayscale();
pixelate(1);
color_invert();
black_and_white(1);
```
