### Learning my tool
In the past month I have been learning my tool **Vidcode.** How I did this is by thinkering of [Vidcode](https://www.vidcode.com/project/intro)

### FP goal for Winter break
My goal is to continue learning Videcode and work on a project that has a button and when you click the button a image show up with a black and white fliter on it. How i will do this is set curtain days to work on this project. And the rest will be having fun with my family.

## EDP
I am still currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been researching the problem that I have. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making progress on research the problem. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue. This is why I am still on the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Time management**, and **Organization**.

### Time management
While working on the website I also on vacation in Florida for Christmas. I had to manage time doing this, time with family, time relaxing. So I set curtain days to tinker with my tool. The rest of the days in Florida can be with family or relaxing the hot weather. With this scheduling I will learn more about my website and had fun in Flordia with my family. Now I have learned to balance time to do certain things.

### Organization
I have always been a unorganized person. But for school and mostly for this computer I have learned to have organized my tabs into folders to each class. For example my SEP folder has websites like:

* Github
* Sep11 Notes
* Hstat Sep students page
* Ide

Now I can feel like I can focus on one class at a time with this trick.

## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
