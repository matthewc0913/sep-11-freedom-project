### Learning my tool
In the past month I have been learning my tool **Vidcode.** How I did this is by thinkering on [Vidcode](https://www.vidcode.com/project/intro). I was working on how can I use vidcode to change different features on photos. For example adding different filters changing the picture's text color, font, size, postition, and the emoji's size, and postition.

#### Code:
```
movie = image();
movie.source = "loki.jpeg";
blur(5);
noise(5);
exposure(90);
grayscale();
pixelate(1);
color_invert();
black_and_white(1);
```
```
movie = video();
movie.source = "lavalamp.mp4";
var emoji = text('ðŸ˜ˆ')
emoji.x = 510;
emoji.y= 350;
var my_graphic2 = graphic("rainbow.png");
emoji.size= 100;
var my_text = text("I'm an AMAZING coder!")
my_text.x = 20;
my_text.y= 200;
my_text.color= "#00E1FF"
my_text.size = 50
my_text.font = "Comic Sans MS"
```

This code showed me how Vidcode can change the way a picture or video looks on a website. For Example I used Blur, pixelate, black and white, grayscale, change the text color, font, size, postition, and I also added an emoji and changed it's size, and postition. I liked seeing the videos and images change using the different fliters. 

### FP goal for Winter break
My goal is to continue learning Videcode and work on a project that has a button and when you click the button a image show up with a black and white fliter on it. How i will do this is set curtain days to work on this project. And the rest will be having fun with my family.

## EDP
I am still currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been researching the problem that I have. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making progress on research the problem. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue. This is why I am still on the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Time management**, and **Organization**.

### Time management
While working on the website I also on vacation in Florida for Christmas. I had to manage time doing this, time with family, time relaxing. So I set curtain days to tinker with my tool. The rest of the days in Florida can be with family or relaxing the hot weather. I use [Google Calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r) to know what days I should be working on my FP. With this scheduling I will learn more about my website and had fun in Flordia with my family. Now I have learned to balance time to do certain things.

### Organization
I have always been a unorganized person. But for school and mostly for this computer I have learned to have organized my tabs into folders to each class. This way I can focus on one class at a time. Shifting my focus on to one class can make me more absorbed in the lesson I am learning. For example my SEP folder has websites like:

* Github
* Sep11 Notes
* Hstat Sep students page
* CS50 (IDE)

Now I can feel like I can focus on one class at a time with this trick.

## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
