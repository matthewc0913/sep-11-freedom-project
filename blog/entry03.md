### Learning my tool

## EDP
I am still currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been researching the problem that I have. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making progress on research the problem. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue. This is why I am still on the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are ****, and **Organization**.

### 


### Organization
I have always been a unorganized person. But for school and mostly for this computer I have learned to have organized my tabs into folders to each class. This way I can focus on one class at a time. Shifting my focus on to one class can make me more absorbed in the lesson I am learning. For example my SEP folder has websites like:

* Github
* Sep11 Notes
* Hstat Sep students page
* CS50 (IDE)

Now I can feel like I can focus on one class at a time with this trick.


## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
