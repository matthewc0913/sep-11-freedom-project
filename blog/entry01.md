## Content
I had to find and tinker with a tool for my freedom project. 

### Vidcode
I decided to use the tool Vidcode. Vidcode can use videos or images as background to your website and using vidcode you can also modify videos, images, and objects, add filters, text, and other graphics to the website. To go to the vidcode website you can click **[here](https://www.vidcode.com/).**

### Tinkering
I thinkered with Vidcode by using an image on my computer and adding multiple filters to the picture that I used. I changed other stuff that you can see in the code below.

The code:
```
movie = image();
movie.source = "loki.jpeg";
blur(5);
noise(5);
exposure(90);
grayscale();
pixelate(1);
color_invert();
black_and_white(1);
```

I liked tinkering with Vidcode. I liked seeing the videos and images change using the different fliters. 

## EDP
I am currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been researching the problem that I have. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue. This is why I am on the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **How to Google**, and **How to learn**.

### How to Google
To learn Vidcode I needed to Google how to use it. When I Vidcode, I don't want to look at 20,500 results especially the results I have already seen or the results that have nothing to do with Vidcode. That is why I have learned that the hyphen (**-**) tells Google that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. So I have been use the hyphen in my google searches to help me filter my google searches. Also I typed _How to use Vidcode -tutorial_ on Google and saw **[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk)** tutorial which told me how Vidcode works and how to effective use it. Now I know how to use Google more effectively.

### How to learn
To learn Vidcode I need to tinker with the tool. I learned Vidcode by watching a tutorial and tinkered with it. I thinkered with Vidcode by using an image on my computer and adding multiple filters to the picture that I used. I also looked at **[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk)** tutorial which told me how Vidcode works and how to effective use it. is how I'm learning on my own.

## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
